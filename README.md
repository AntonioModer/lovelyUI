# lovelyUI - a simple LÃ–VE UI library

---

This little library is supposed to help you to quickly set up a simple UI, which however leaves you as much freedom as you want. It offers simple element creation, percentage based positioning, a simple text animation and other things. Most of the options can be configured, so, for example, shouldn't you like percentage based position, just turn it off!

**Hey folks, small lua-style disclaimer**: Although I don't always use *self* in functions I generally differentiate between attributes (table.attribute) and functions (table:function)

## how to use

Simply download the lovelyui.lua file and require it in your project like this:

    lovelyui = require 'path.to.folder.lovelyui'

and execute the lovelyui update and draw functions in the respective love.update and love.draw functions (or whatever you use) like this:

	function love.update (dt)
		lovelyui:update (dt)
	end

	function love.draw ()
		lovelyui:draw ()
	end

## example

![here should be an example](https://github.com/partnano/lovelyui/blob/master/example.gif "Example")

for the code, see ***main.lua***

## how to configure

Via the  
    
    :set_defaults ({--array of options--})

function, you can set your base config. These options are available (with their respective default values):

    width, height    = window width & height         -- for percentage positioning calculations
    perc_coords      = true                          -- percentage position turned on / off
    box              = lovelyui.box_themes.rectangle -- theme for the elements (function)
    border_color     = {255, 255, 255}               -- border color
    text_color       = {255, 255, 255}               -- text color
    background_color = {50, 50, 50}                  -- background color
    text_padding     = 10                            -- inner distance text to border
    text_anim        = true                          -- text animation turned on / off
    smooth_speed     = 10                            -- animation speed in ms

Most of these options are configurable on an element basis as well.

## elements

Currently 3 types of elements & a simple layouting mechanism are available:

### text box

A textbox that displays text and optionally an image.

    :new_textbox (lines, x, y, width, height, [image])

            lines:  an array of strings, which will be displayed in the textbox  
             x, y:  top right screen coordinates (will be recalculated if perc_coords = true)
	width, height:  size (will be recalculated if perc_coords = true)
            image:  optional possibility to also display an image in the top right of the box

These attributes and functions are available:

        lines:  array of all the text lines
    curr_line:  the currently displayed line
          img:  the image displayed

          next():  display next line in array
          prev():  display prev line in array
    reset_anim():  resets text animation of current line (no effect if text_anim = false)

### selection box

A box of horizontal options (text lines) with indicator (currently a ">")

    :new_selectionbox (lines, x, y, width, height)

    for variable description see above

These attributes and functions are available:

    lines:  array of all the options
    
    curr_hover():  returns the line / option that is currently indicated
            up():  moves indicator up
          down():  moves indicator down

### yes / no selection box

A small yes / no dialogue

    :new_ynbox (text, x, y, width, height)

    text:  the string displayed in the box
	for rest see above

These attributes and functions are available:

	    text:  displayed string
	yes_text:  string for the yes answer
	 no_text:  string for the no answer
	 yn_font:  font for the yes / no strings

	yes():  yes action
	 no():  no action

The yes & no functions are special, as you have to define them yourself, as they are not doing much per default (just printing a statement).

example:

	function my_ynbox:yes ()
		level_up_char ()
		print ("Level upped your character!")
	end

### layouts

layouts are non-drawn elements, which give the ability to group elements, move them together and limit the area, in which they are drawn. (Always going from the origin x/y (top right))

	:new_layout (x, y, width, height)

These attributes and functions are available:

	elements:  the elements managed by this layout

	   add_element(e):  add an element to the layout
	remove_element(e):  removes specified element from the layout
	    set_active(e):  sets the specified element in the layout active
	     get_active():  returns the current active element (nil if no active)
	
	  up(), down():  active element functions (if active is a selectionbox)
	next(), prev():  active element functions (if active is a textbox)
	   yes(), no():  active element functions (if active is a ynbox)

### general attributes & functions

these attributes and functions are available for all elements:

	         padding:  distance text to border
	       box_theme:  the theme of the element
	    border_color
	      text_color
	background_color
	            font

	 get_pos():  returns pixel position
    get_size():  returns pixel size
	 set_pos():  sets element position (& recalcs if percentage based)
	set_size():  sets element size (& recalcs if percentage based)
	    hide():  hides element (doesn't get drawn until show() is called)
	    show():  shows element if it was hidden

the active mechanism that is available for layouts is globally available as well:

	lovelyui:set_active(e): sets specified element to active one
	lovelyui:get_active():  returns current active element (nil if there isn't one)
	
	lovelyui:up(), down(), next(), prev(), yes(), no()

### themes

Currently there are 3 really simple default themes:

	lovelyui.box_themes.rectangle
	lovelyui.box_themes.rounded_rectangle
	lovelyui.box_themes.ellipse

These are not really special at all, but this was not the intended goal. For your own purposes just define a theme function that takes 5 parameters:

	         x, y: top right pixel coordinates of element
	width, height: pixel size of element
	            e: the element itself if anything else is needed (e.g. the different colors)

Here is a simple example directly from the library code:

	function rectangle (x, y, w, h, e)	
		love.graphics.setColor (e.background_color)
		love.graphics.rectangle ('fill', x, y, w, h)

		love.graphics.setColor (e.border_color)
		love.graphics.rectangle ('line', x, y, w, h)
    end

Assign your function to either the base option lovelyui.box_theme or to any element.box_theme and you're set!
