# lovelyUI - a simple LÃ–VE UI library

---

This little library is supposed to help you to quickly set up a simple UI, which however leaves you as much freedom as you want. It offers simple create-and-go element creation, percentage based positioning, a simple text animation and other things. It also features a do-it-yourself theming mechanism, to give you full control over what is actually drawn on screen!

**Hey folks, small lua-style disclaimer**: Although I don't always use *self* in functions I generally differentiate between attributes (table.attribute) and functions (table:function)

## how to use

Simply download the lovelyui.lua file and require it in your project like this:

    lovelyui = require 'path.to.folder.lovelyui'

and execute the lovelyui update and draw functions in the respective love.update and love.draw functions (or whatever you use) like this:

	function love.update (dt)
		lovelyui:update (dt)
	end

	function love.draw ()
		lovelyui:draw ()
	end

## example

![here should be an example](https://github.com/partnano/lovelyUI/blob/master/dat/example.gif "Example")

for the code, see ***main.lua***

## how to configure

Via the
    
    :set_defaults ({--array of options--})

function, you can set your base config. These options are available (with their respective default values):

    width, height    = window width & height         -- for percentage positioning calculations
    perc_coords      = true                          -- percentage position turned on / off
    box              = lovelyui.box_themes.rectangle -- theme for the elements (function)
    text_padding     = 10                            -- inner distance text to border
    text_anim        = true                          -- text animation turned on / off
    smooth_speed     = 10                            -- animation speed in ms

Most of these options are configurable on an element basis as well.

## elements

Currently 3 types of elements & a simple layouting mechanism are available:

### text box

A textbox that displays text and optionally an image.

    :new_textbox (lines, x, y, width, height, [image])

            lines:  an array of strings, which will be displayed in the textbox  
             x, y:  top right screen coordinates (will be recalculated if perc_coords = true)
	width, height:  size (will be recalculated if perc_coords = true)
            image:  optional possibility to also display an image in the top right of the box

These attributes and functions are available:

        lines:  all text lines (array)
    curr_line:  the currently displayed line (string)
          img:  the image displayed (love image)
	 at_begin:  true if displaying first line in array (boolean)
	   at_end:  true if displaying last line in array (boolean)

          next():  display next line in array
          prev():  display prev line in array
    reset_anim():  resets text animation of current line (no effect if text_anim = false)

### selection box

A box of horizontal options (text lines) with indicator (currently a ">")

    :new_selectionbox (lines, x, y, width, height)

    for variable description see above

These attributes and functions are available:

	    lines:  all options (array)
	indicator:  the symbol shown to indicate the selected line (string)
    
        curr_hover():  returns the line / option that is currently indicated
                up():  moves indicator up
		      down():  moves indicator down
    set_indicator(i):  moves indicator to specified location (int)	

### yes / no selection box

A small yes / no dialogue

    :new_ynbox (text, x, y, width, height)

    text:  the string displayed in the box
	for rest see above

These attributes and functions are available:

	    text:  displayed string (string)
	yes_text:  yes text (string)
	 no_text:  no text (string)
	 yn_font:  font for the yes / no strings (love font)

	yes():  yes action
	 no():  no action

The yes & no functions are special, as you have to define them yourself, as they are not doing much per default (just printing a statement).

example:

	function my_ynbox:yes ()
		level_up_char ()
		print ("Level upped your character!")
	end

### layouts

Layouts are non-drawn elements to manage and group other elements. These are really only useful with percentage based positioning,
since they scale and position relative to the layout values. (e.g. x=0 is layout-x and x=100 is layout-x+layout-w

	:new_layout (x, y, width, height)

These attributes and functions are available:

	elements:  the elements managed by this layout

	   add_element(e):  add an element to the layout (lovelyUI element)
	remove_element(e):  removes specified element from the layout (lovelyUI element)

### general attributes & functions

these attributes and functions are available for all elements:

	         padding:  pixel distance text to border (int)
	       box_theme:  the theme of the element (function)
	            font:  font of the text in the element (love font)
    (attributes don't affect layouts)

	      get_pos():  returns pixel position
	     get_size():  returns pixel size
	 get_orig_pos():  gets the originally specified position (e.g. percentage coords)
	get_orig_size():  gets the originally specified size (e.g. percentage size)
	  set_pos(x, y):  sets element position (& recalcs if percentage based) (float, float)
	 set_size(w, h):  sets element size (& recalcs if percentage based) (float, float)
	         hide():  hides element (doesn't get drawn until show() is called)
	         show():  shows element if it was hidden
		  destroy():  removes element from lovelyUI draw stack (if you want to only hide temporarily, use hide())
		      top():  pushes element to the top of the drawing stack (drawing it last; on top of every other element)	

A global active mechanism is available as well, for focusing a single element and calling an action easily globally:

	lovelyui:set_active(e):  sets specified element to active one (lovelyUI element)
	 lovelyui:get_active():  returns current active element (nil if there isn't one)

the following functions are available globally without throwing an error, however will only do something for the respective elements

	lovelyui:up(),   down() -- for selection boxes
	         next(), prev() -- for text boxes
		     yes(),  no()   -- for yes/no boxes

### themes

For now these few themes are available:

	lovelyui.box_themes.double_border_dark
	lovelyui.box_themes.double_border_light
	lovelyui.box_themes.old_school
	lovelyui.box_themes.simple_transparent_dark (default)
	lovelyui.box_themes.simple_transparent_light

These are not really special at all, but this was not the intended goal. For your own purposes just define a theme function that takes 4-6 parameters:

	function (x, y, width, height, [active, [element]])

	         x, y:  top right pixel coordinates of element
	width, height:  pixel size of element
		   active:  true/false depending if the element is active
	      element:  the element itself if anything else is needed (optional)

Here is a simple example (for some other examples look at the library functions):

	rounded_rectangle = function (x, y, w, h, a)	
		lg.setColor ({230, 230, 230})
		lg.rectangle ('fill', x, y, w, h, 10, 10, 10)

	    if a then lg.setColor ({20, 230, 20})
	    else lg.setColor ({80, 80, 80}) end
	
	    lg.rectangle ('line', x, y, w, h, 10, 10, 20)

	    -- last setcolor is for the text color
	    lg.setColor ({20, 20, 20})
    end

Since you get the relevant coordinates, you can draw whatever you want.
Assign your function to either the base option lovelyui.box_theme or to any element.box_theme and you're set!
